# Simple Synchronous RAM Design Using Verilog
This project implements a *simple synchronous RAM module* using Verilog HDL. The design allows *read and write operations* to a memory array on the rising edge of a clock signal. It serves as an educational example for understanding the internal operation of Random Access Memory in digital systems, especially in FPGA or ASIC design contexts.

In addition to the core Verilog RAM module, this project includes a testbench that demonstrates the correct functionality of reading from and writing to memory. Simulation results verify the expected behavior of the RAM under various input conditions.
##  Features
- *Synchronous operation*: All memory access is performed on the positive edge of the clock.
- *Parameterized design*: Data width and address width can be customized.
- *Memory array*: Supports 2^ADDR_WIDTH memory locations.
- *Read-after-write* support: Read and write can be done to the same address in the same clock cycle.
- *Testbench included*: Functional simulation testbench validates core memory operations.

Output-
